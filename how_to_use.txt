How to use Audit
===========================================
Scope of audit is to generate a file that you can run in MySQL fin order to modify the target schema for auditing.
This is accomplish adding triggers for each audited table that will catch the not authorized modifications.
All the modification will be then saved in a parallel schema that will store all the modified data, in a structure
that is equal to the original one.

It is possible to run the audit package specifing all the parameters in command line format, or using a configuration file.

audit.pl --defaults-file=/temp/audit/test.ini

audit.pl -u=mysql_user -p=mysql -H=127.0.0.1 -P=5506 -a=root,app_user -i=employees,test -o=/test/audit/employees_13_01_2010.sql


To run the check, in order to identify inconsistency use the reportmodification parameter [0 it is not enabled | 1 it is enable]
